  <em>Rockway</em>

<p>
  "Rockway Conservation Area is part of the Niagara Escarpment and offers history and beauty in a remote setting. Hike the trail into the Fifteen Mile Creek valley to experience mature Basswood, Sugar Maple, Black Walnut and Sycamore trees.
Two spectacular waterfalls plunge from heights of 19.5 meters and 12.2 meters. The watercourse continues downriver, surging over a series of rapids.
Boasting some of the best quality and quantity of salt in Ontario, the salt spring dates as far back as 1792. Area facilities include limited parking off 9th Avenue on escarpment tablelands."

<h3>
  <em>Cave Springs</em>
</h3>
<p>
  "This property features spectacular vistas overlooking Lake Ontario and the old Lake Iroquois shore, and is an exquisite representation of the Niagara Escarpment’s talus slopes and cliffs. The escarpment rim and bedrock plain forests are dominated by Sugar Maples. The rich and unique diversity of plants and habitat on these rare escarpment features provide a linear migration corridor for animals and plants."

<h3>
  <em>Chippawa Creek</em>
</h3>
<p>
  "Chippawa Creek is a splendid example of conservation in action. The NPCA’s resource management practices have fostered an ideal wildlife habitat that offers rare public access to the Welland River. Recreationalists and naturalists alike will enjoy a variety of opportunities and activities that is uncommon in the southernmost part of Ontario. Many visitors to Chippawa Creek used to think they had to drive north for the experiences available here.
Dils Lake, a 10 hectare man made reservoir, is the perfect spot for a variety of outdoor activities including non-motorized boating, swimming and fishing. Equipped with wheelchair-accessible fishing piers and trails, the lake is populated by a variety of fish species including large mouth bass, crappie and carp and is a favourite amongst area anglers, many of whom attend the annual Bass Derby held each July. Additional events hosted by the Campers’ Recreation Committee include Canada Day parade, Halloween Celebrations, and Christmas in July.
In addition to offering 156 campsites, the vast open areas can be used year round. Popular summer activities include hiking the 1.1 km trail around Dils Lake, group picnics, or just relaxing in the shade near the water. Please note, bookings open in April of every year."
